Go watch the video, cya." Garcia's video looks to have been shot in an apartment; a poster for Evanescence and Snoopy can be seen in the backdrop. He is barely seen on the video for about 23 seconds before he covers the camera lens and starts playing music over a smiley face that appears to have been created to look like Hitler.</p><h2 class=split>'Face reveal'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/36ba81f5-f9e8-4541-bd34-10f662e54d10.png><p>The "face reveal" video was uploaded prior to the shooting but was intended to be released following the heinous act. According to Bellingcat researcher Aric Toler, it happened after his account published images of Nazis, weapons, and ammo as well as extreme rants on Jews, women, and racial minorities. He posted more than a dozen images of the retail mall and its surroundings just three weeks before he committed the horrific shooting, along with screenshots of Google location data recording peak visitor hours.

Garcia posted a picture of himself next to a Hooters waitress in a Texas location on a Russian social media account.

Someone wrote a positive message along with the tribute, "Hugely tragic for all the families who lost a loved one & for that matter even those who got injured. Life is so unpredictable letâ€™s all try to be the best we can." "This thread made me sick to my stomach. May their souls be at peace," mentioned another. A user claimed to have asked one of the victims where the restrooms were when visiting the mall. He wrote, "I canâ€™t believe this."
