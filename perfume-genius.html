His parents had got divorced when he was a teenager and he used to live with his mother after that.</li><li>He was interested in music and arts from a very young age. He had studied painting at school and had also taken piano lessons.</li><li>Perfume Genius was an openly gay student at his school and he would often get bullied as a result. He was even sent death threats by some of his schoolmates but unfortunately, his complaints were always ignored by the school’s administration. He eventually dropped out of high school due to the stress.</li><li>A couple of years after this, he was attacked by a group of men in his locality. Fed up with the constant abuse, he left Seattle and moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn. There, he worked for some time as a doorman at a local club.</li><li>Perfume Genius decided to return to Seattle in 2005 and pursue a career in music. He began getting recognition in 2008 when he started sharing his music on the Myspace social networking site under the pseudonym Perfume Genius. He was soon signed up by Matador Records and released his first studio album titled Learning&nbsp;in 2010. Most of the tracks on the album were recorded in his name.</li><p>Featured Image by Perfume Genius / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqmcq56lorJus8SnoK6rXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
