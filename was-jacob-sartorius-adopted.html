Shortly after he was born, Jacob was adopted because his birth parents were not in a position to raise him.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Read on to learn more about why Jacob was adopted.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jacob’s Adoption Story</h2><p>Jacob shared a <a href=# rel=noopener>YouTube video</a> in August of 2016, where he revealed to his fans that he was adopted as a baby.&nbsp;</p><p>The star said, “I’m very open with you guys and I try to share everything that’s going on in my life because I consider you guys like my family.”</p><p>“Speaking of family, I have something to tell you guys that I think will make us all closer and allow you to get to know me better,” he continued.</p><p>Jacob then explained that although he grew up in the state of Virginia he wasn’t born there—he was born in Oklahoma.</p><p>“At the time [of my birth], my birth parents weren’t able to take care of me, so they made a plan for me to be adopted,” he shared.</p><p>He explained further, “Luckily for me, I was blessed to be able to be adopted by two of the most loving parents in the world—my mom and my dad.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-facebook wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-facebook"></figure><p>He goes on to talk about how being adopted was a great thing. He revealed that his adoptive parents have given him a fantastic childhood and that he wouldn’t want to change what happened.</p><p>He then reassured his fans that nothing has changed, since Jacob has always been aware that he was adopted.</p><p>“I’m still me and being adopted is something that I’ve never tried to hide or keep a secret,” he said.</p><p>He concludes the video by explaining that, “My friends and family have known all this, but I think it’s time for you guys to know too… I know this is only going to make us closer.”</p><p>He also tells his fans he loves them and thanks them for being so supportive through “thick and thin.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why was Jacob adopted?</h2><p>The answer isn’t clear. <a href=# rel=noopener>Jacob only revealed</a> that his birth parents were unable to take care of him. He didn’t give explicit reasons as to why his biological parents decided adoption was best for their son.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps Jacob knows the whole truth but doesn’t want to give away such intimate details on a public platform. Or, perhaps this is the full extent of knowledge he has on the matter.</p><p>In any case, fans should feel happy that Jacob had a good upbringing with his adoptive parents that he considers to be his true Mom and Dad.</p><p>Watch Jacob’s YouTube video below to get all the known information on the topic.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCYrGWalrCwroysmKusn6e2tr%2BMmpuoqKSasXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
