She recently appeared as a guest on the Call Her Daddy podcast, where she discussed her channel, relationships, and other topics.&nbsp;Chamberlain typically keeps her love life quiet, but on this particular occasion, she spoke out about her previous romances without identifying anybody. Here are some of her comments regarding her ex-boyfriends:</p><p>“I discovered that in previous relationships, I didn’t feel as valued by the males I dated. Because I feel like they sort of, one specific connection in particular, but it was just like, I just felt like, you know, he was really judgmental of the fact that I wasn’t a particularly feminine lady.” “I felt as if I wasn’t enough, and that the places where I was feminine weren’t enough, therefore I felt as if there was an attempt to make me more feminine.”</p><p>Fans assume she was referring to her ex, Ethan Dolan. In 2018-19, the two were thought to be dating while simultaneously working on material for their group “Sister Squad,” which included Emma Chamberlain, James Charles, and the Dolan Twins.&nbsp;Chamberlain is also said to be dating Tucker Pillsbury, popularly known as Role Model. He is a singer, composer, and former rapper from the United States.&nbsp;Emma Chamberlain’s dating history may be seen on her YouTube channel.</p><h2>A look into Emma Chamberlain’s relationships.</h2><p><strong>1) Ethan Dolan</strong></p><p>Rumors of a relationship between Dolan and Chamberlain began in early 2018 when the two were regularly seen together and working on stuff. They were also members of the Sister Squad and collaborated on many videos.&nbsp;When Dolan revealed to dating someone in late 2018, people assumed it was Chamberlain based on their chemistry. Apparently, the two split up in 2019 and ceased producing video together.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ethan-Dolan.jpg alt="Ethan Dolan" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>2) Aaron Hull</strong></p><p>Hull and Chamberlain’s relationship first came to light in late 2019, while the two were working together on projects. Chamberlain’s video “Learning How to Skateboard to Impress a Guy” fanned the suspicions even more. Hull is known to be a skateboarding lover.&nbsp;They did, however, split up sometime in January 2020. Hull addressed their relationship in a video he made in September of that year, claiming that the two just didn’t function well together, leading to their split. Among the things he says in the video are:</p><p>“Distance and everything else, the calculation was simply too difficult.” From my perspective, I believe.” “Emma was the best girlfriend I could have hoped for; I couldn’t have asked for anything more from her.” She was really encouraging to me.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Aaron-Hull.jpg alt="Aaron Hull" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>3)Tucker Pillsbury</strong></p><p>Pillsbury and Chamberlain are said to have been dating since August 2020, since they have been sighted together many times.
