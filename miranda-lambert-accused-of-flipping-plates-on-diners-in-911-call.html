At the end of that call, the operator informed the manager, “We’ve got customers calling in too.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Miranda-Lambert-Accused-Flipping-Plates-Nashville-Diner-02.jpg><p><a href=#>TMZ</a> reported earlier this week that Lambert allegedly dumped a salad on a woman’s lap during the confrontation. The two-time Grammy winner and her party left the scene before police arrived.
