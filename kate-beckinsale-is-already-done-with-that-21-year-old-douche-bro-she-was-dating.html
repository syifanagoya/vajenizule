I said at the time that this kid looked like gonorrhea personified. Rife is the kind of next-gen comedian who, like, worships Dane Cook. He also seemed to sense that dating Kate Beckinsale would be his big break, because there was a concerted “rollout” for the news, which included a “things to know about Matt Rife” article on E!, an Entertainment Tonight exclusive, and photos of Matt and Kate kissing. The whole thing seemed… gross. Well, it looks like Beckinsale sort of agreed with us and the fling was over really quickly.</p><p>It’s over before it really began. Kate Beckinsale’s fledgling romance with Matt Rife, a 21-year-old aspiring actor, has “fizzled out” a source tells Us Weekly exclusively. The Underworld: Blood Wars star, 44, who split from husband Len Wiseman in November 2015 after 11 years of marriage, was spotted out on a date with Rife at the Sherman Oaks Galleria on June 27.</p><p>The British actress couldn’t keep her hands off Rife, who is only three years older than her daughter, Lily, whose father is Beckinsale’s ex Michael Sheen. Less than a week earlier, the photogenic couple had been seen making out outside Villa Lounge in West Hollywood.</p><p>“They went on a couple of fun dates,” a source tells Us. “It fizzled out weeks ago. She’s happily single and has a lot going on.” A second source tells Us that “Kate is very busy with her daughter and her career.”</p><p><a href=#>[From Us Weekly]</a></p><p>Translation: Kate hit it and quit it and hopes that no one will remember that she briefly shame-banged a guy who seemed like an utter douche-bro. I mean, I get it – it’s the fantasy of a younger man, someone new and fresh, someone who will adore your experience, wit and wisdom and everything will be so novel and new to him, of course he’ll be uber-grateful. If the guy looked like a young Tom Hardy or a young Clive Owen, then sure, go for it. But don’t go for some 21-year-old d-bag frat boy who makes “rape jokes” on Twitter. That’s embarrassing.</p><p>Oh, douche-bro. We hardly knew you.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wenn23753562.jpg alt="Star Magazine’s ‘Hollywood Rocks’ Event - Arrivals" width=470 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wenn30815940.jpg alt="'The Comedian' - Premiere" width=470 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbmxlaoVxe8qaq56XkpqwrLXNrJilnY%2BewKCty6ucmpyplLGwusSYrqKsmJTBqa3TmGlqZamarrN5zqWbmJyfqrCpsYybqaiXo52yoMPArJadmaSeu6h7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
