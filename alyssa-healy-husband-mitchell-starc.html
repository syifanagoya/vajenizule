Healy and Starc, a beloved couple in the cricketing community, always support each other during important matches.&nbsp;</p><p>Starc attended one of Healy’s matches at the 2022 ODI World Cup in New Zealand, and he revealed that he had sacrificed some time from his Test career to spend more time with her.&nbsp;</p><p>Healy and Starc are considered the power couple of Australian cricket, and their success on the field is proof of that. However, their relationship began long before they reached the elite level, and in fact, they first met during their primary school days.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Here is how childhood friendship turned to love for these cricket stars. Read along to find more details.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Alyssa Healy and Mitchell Starc first met when they were nine</h2><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Newstrack</a>, the couple’s first encounter was at 9 during cricket training for Sydney’s Northern District Cricket Association. They were both vying for the same position as wicketkeepers in the under-10s team.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the competition, they bonded over sharing tips and improving their skills as wicketkeepers. However, Healy briefly left cricket at 15 while Starc continued to pursue his cricket career. Despite this, their bond as teammates stayed strong for nine years.&nbsp;</p><p>As the source mentioned, Starc expressed his love for Healy: “I am fond of that little keeper and want to spend my entire life with her. She is clearly very talented and can compete with the boys.” Since then, they have remained together and supportive of each other’s careers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Alyssa Healy and Mitchell Starc got married in 2016</h2><p>This couple, who were once teammates, are now life partners. They got married in 2016 and have been moving forward together ever since. The pair has been married for over 5 years as of 2023. Starc considers himself lucky to have found his soulmate in Healy, even though she plays for the Sydney Sixers in the Women’s Big Bash League.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Healy, the daughter of Queensland cricketer Greg Healy and the niece of Australian Test match wicketkeeper Ian Healy, believes that married life is going well for them despite not being able to spend much time with her husband since their wedding. She said, “Life hasn’t changed much for us since he had an extra ring on his finger when we got engaged.”&nbsp;</p><p>They spent a lot of time together on their honeymoon, and everyone told them they had a great marriage, but age was never a factor for them.&nbsp;</p><p>Healy has been playing internationally for six straight years, winning the Ashes in 2015, while Starc is one of the world’s best fast bowlers, having become only the fifth person to bowl at speeds exceeding 160 km/h.</p><p>Starc also revealed that Healy was the only girl on her cricket team. Despite being behind in training, she would chat with the other boys on social media. However, she never considered herself any different from the other players.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Alyssa-Healy-And-Husband-Mitchell-Starc-Together-Since-2016.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Alyssa Healy land Mitchell Starc spending time together (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>She considered herself normal and just one of the girls.

None are catching the eye more than Jevon Holland. The 23-year-old Coquitlam-born safety was drafted by the Miami Dolphins in 2021 after impressing in two seasons of college football with the Oregon Ducks.</p><p>Holland has not looked back ever since, establishing himself as a regular in the Dolphins team, posting some serious tackle and interception figures.</p><p>In fact, Holland is now the starting free safety position for Miami. So far in 2023, Holland has registered 44 solo tackles, just four shy of the 48 he amassed in his entire debut season in 2021.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Holland and the Dolphins are in great shape for a 2024 Super Bowl bid</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Alyssa_Mitchell-535x400.jpg><p>Holland could be celebrating winning his first Lombardi Trophy next year too if the bookmakers’ odds are to be believed. The Dolphins are currently rated as +800 fifth favorites to land the 2024 Super Bowl with the <a href=# rel=noopener>Ontario-licensed sports betting online operator Betano</a>, which has served the Canadian province since receiving its license in October 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Holland’s first ever NFL touchdown was a big one – in more ways than one!</h2><p>Holland played a key role in the Dolphins’ recent victory over the New York Jets. Holland completed a stunning interception of a hail Mary pass, before returning it with interest for a stunning 99-yard touchdown. It was the first touchdown of Holland’s NFL career and it steered Miami to a comfortable 34-13 victory.</p><p>It’s a win which keeps Miami firmly top of the AFC East. In fact, only the Baltimore Ravens have made a better start to the 2023-24 NFL season in the AFC.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The British Columbian safety did more than assist the Dolphins in their quest for victory over the Jets that day. His full-field return triggered an eagerly anticipated giveaway worth over $1 million. During the NFL preseason, electronics firm TCL launched its “Ultimate Gameday Upgrade” committing to give away $1 million worth of 98” televisions if a player managed to score a touchdown from a minimum of 98 yards in.</p><p>Holland beat the minimum by a single yard. TCL also made sure Holland received a 98” TV too, as reward for his feat.</p><p>Holland has missed the last few games for the Dolphins after sustaining a sprain to his medial ligaments in both knees. This disappointing injury was suffered in the same game as his majestic touchdown against the Jets.</p><p>The team continues to use kid gloves with Holland, pushing him only sparingly into team practice. Holland himself admits <a href=# rel=noopener>he’s “taking his time” with his rehab</a> to ensure he returns at the peak of his powers.</p><p>The Dolphins realize just how important Holland has become to their defense, as he also serves as the quarterback of the secondary. Head coach Mike McDaniel described Holland as being “diligent” with his recovery, especially with the chance of a deep postseason run looming.</p><p><strong>Holland’s path to NFL stardom</strong></p><p>Miami is reaping the rewards of recognizing Holland’s undoubted potential in the NFL after making him their second-round pick of the 2021 NFL Draft. Holland had impressed during his scholarship with the Oregon Ducks in the <a href=#>same way as outside linebacker Kayvon Thibodeaux</a>, who was later recruited by the New York Giants.</p><p>Holland’s rookie season saw him display his physical prowess from day one. He exhibited a rare combination of athleticism, football intelligence, and a knack for disrupting opposing offenses. His ability to cover ground in the secondary, make crucial tackles, and create turnovers has earned him rave reviews from Dolphins fans and respect from his peers across the league.</p><p>Beyond his on-field contributions, Holland’s leadership qualities and adaptability have also been noteworthy. Whether patrolling the backfield or contributing on special teams, Holland has quickly established himself as a versatile asset to the Dolphins.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Santi Aldama Is Getting Married to His Girlfriend Pilar Barquin</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>Congrats to the couple!</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Santi-Aldama-Girlfriend.jpg alt="Santi Aldama Is Getting Married to His Girlfriend Pilar Barquin" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Santi Aldama is a Spanish professional basketball player for the National Basketball Association’s (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NBA</a>) Memphis Grizzlies.</p><p>Before being drafted into the NBA, he was a Loyola Greyhounds basketball player in college.

Aldama has not referred to Barquin as his wife, and neither has Barquin referred to the athlete as her husband.</p><p>So, it looks like the two are not married yet but might be planning for their dream wedding.
