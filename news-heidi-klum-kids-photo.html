This week, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><strong>Heidi Klum</strong> posted a photo of all four of her kids</a> on Instagram with the caption, "Today it's …… bring ALL your kids to work day." The group was in a van together headed to the set of Germany's Next Topmodel, which Klum hosts.</p><p>Klum often posts photos and videos of herself <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>having fun with her kids</a>, but it's more rare for her to share pics that show all of them together. Klum shares her four children—<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>16-year-old <strong>Leni</strong></a>, 15-year-old <strong>Henry</strong>, 14-year-old <strong>Johan</strong>, and 11-year-old <strong>Lou</strong>—with ex-husband <strong>Seal</strong>. Leni's biological father is Italian businessman <strong>Flavio Briatore</strong>, but she was later adopted by Seal.</p><p>Read on to see Klum's photo of the whole gang together, and for more cute moments with her family.

The day that her kids went to work with her, Klum also shared that her <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>guest judge for that episode was <strong>Bill Kaulitz</strong></a>, the twin brother and Tokio Hotel bandmate of Klum's husband, <strong>Tom Kaulitz</strong>.</p><p>For more celeb couples who prove age is nothing but a number like Klum and Kaulitz, check out <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>27 Celebrity Couples With Huge Age Gaps</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Heidi-Klum-family-Christmas.jpeg><p>Around Christmastime, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Klum shared a photo</a> that shows herself, Tom, Bill, and all the kids sitting around a tree with presents everywhere. The kids all cover their faces with gifts, but you can see that everyone is wearing matching Santa hats with their names embroidered on them.</p><p>For more on celebrities who are raising kids in the spotlight, read <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Jada Pinkett Smith Regrets Doing This One Thing With Her Kids</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Heidi-Klum-and-kids.jpeg><p>In November, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Klum also posted about her kids</a> visiting the set of Germany's Next Topmodel, and it looks like all four of them might have been there once again, though you can't see everyone fully.

As you can see here—in a photo she captioned, "Mother's Day breakfast in bed"—one of her sons blocks out his face with a mug. Meanwhile, 16-year-old Leni is frequently in photos, has her own Instagram account, and even posed for the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>cover of Vogue Germany with her mom</a>.
