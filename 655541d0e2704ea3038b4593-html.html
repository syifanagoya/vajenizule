Sitting at <strong>5-5</strong> with losses in three of their last four games, the team doesn't look like the <strong>AFC powerhouse</strong> that won <strong>47 out of 65 games</strong> from 2019 to 2022 and made the second round of the playoffs in each of the last three seasons.</p><p>Earlier this week, the team<strong><a href=#>fired offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey</a></strong>, even though the offense ranks <strong>third in the NFL in EPA per play</strong>. Their main issues have clearly been <strong>injuries on defense</strong> and the <strong>offense turning the ball over too frequently</strong>. Quarterback <strong><a href=#>Josh Allen</a></strong> has been the culprit on a lot of those turnovers, as he <strong>leads the league in interceptions thrown</strong> (11) and has also <strong>coughed up three fumbles</strong>.</p><figure class="ue-c-article__media ue-c-article__media--video ue-c-article--media-icon-m-from-tablet" readability=1><p><span class=ue-c-article__media-description>Josh Allen uses "sh*t" expletive to define his performance against the Jets</span><span class=ue-c-article__media-author><span>@snyjets</span></span></p></figure><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Josh Allen is Brett Favre?</h2><p>Following another turnover-laden game on Monday night in a loss against the <strong>Denver Broncos</strong>, comparisons began being drawn between Allen and former <strong>Green Bay Packers</strong> legend <strong>Brett Favre</strong>.</p><p>Favre is in the <strong>Hall of Fame</strong> due to his gaudy passing numbers, but he wasn't without his flaws. He earned the nickname "<strong>Gunslinger</strong>" due to his propensity to<strong> throw any pass regardless of the potential outcome</strong>. It's why he has the <strong>most interceptions</strong> thrown in NFL history, with 68 more than the next-closest.</p><p>When you look at their numbers through the first <strong>85-86 games</strong> of their careers, it's <strong>shocking how similar they are</strong>.</p><p>Those numbers don't include Allen's rushing statistics, which are important. The Bills quarterback provides so much on the ground for his team by <strong>extending drives</strong> and also <strong>scoring at a very high rate when running</strong>.</p><p>But none of that will matter much if he keeps turning the ball over so carelessly. Not if Buffalo wants to make it deep into the postseason.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqedpWeSqrOnrcuoZJuhnKHAcH6Pa2poaWFkfnZ7lW5sbmxhmX2mfpZpa56ZY2WAea6TbnBsZpipuq0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
