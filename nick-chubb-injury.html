Chubb may be done for the season. The team suspects a knee dislocation and ligament tears</strong>. After the game, coach Kevin Stefanski said Chubb had a “significant knee injury” and may miss the season. Chubb had a similar knee issue at Georgia in 2015. Losing Chubb is terrible for the Browns. As a top NFL runner, he makes the Pro Bowl every year.<p dir=ltr lang=en><a href=# rel=noopener>#Browns</a> HC Kevin Stefanski told reporters that he expects Nick Chubb to miss the remainder of the season with a “significant” knee injury. <a href=#>https://t.co/SniGq2YM2i</a></p><p>— Jordan Schultz (@Schultz_Report) <a href=# rel=noopener>September 19, 2023</a></p>Jerome Ford and Pierre Strong Jr. are Chubb’s backups. The practice squad adds running back Hassan Hall. Leonard Fournette and Kareem Hunt are free-agent options for the Browns to replace Chubb.

My body moved forward, my leg backwards. I sensed trouble.” Chubb returned the next season and ran for 1,130 yards and five touchdowns after a significant recovery. He surpassed those numbers as a senior, running for 1,345 yards and 15 touchdowns as Georgia won the SEC but lost to Alabama in overtime in the national championship game. The Browns drafted him second in 2018. “Malcolm Gladwell wrote about outliers,” ESPN received from former Georgia sports medical director Ron Courson in 2016. “Nick is unusual. His genes are good. He works hard and is mentally tougher than anyone I’ve seen. I expected his return.” In 2020, Chubb damaged his right MCL and missed four games on injured reserve.<p><strong>You can also take a look at other recent injury details we have provided you in the below posts:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Jamaal Williams Injury Update: When Will American Football Players Play Again?</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Luis Severino Injury Update: When Will He Start Playing Again?</a></li></ul><h2 style=text-align:justify>Reactions to Nick Chubb’s Injury</h2>After Chubb’s injury, active and former NFL players posted on X, formerly Twitter, to encourage him.<p dir=ltr lang=en>Just the worst feeling.</p><p>Gutted for Nick Chubb.</p><p>Hope Minkah is ok.</p><p>Injuries suck man.<br>They absolutely suck.</p><p>— JJ Watt (@JJWatt) <a href=# rel=noopener>September 19, 2023</a></p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Nick Chubb…🙏🏻</p><p>— Trevor Lawrence (@Trevorlawrencee) <a href=# rel=noopener>September 19, 2023</a></p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Praying for you bro🙏🏾<a href=# rel=noopener>@NickChubb</a></p><p>— SAUCE GARDNER (@iamSauceGardner) <a href=# rel=noopener>September 19, 2023</a></p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Prayers for Nick Chubb🙏🏾</p><p>— Lamar Jackson (@Lj_era8) <a href=# rel=noopener>September 19, 2023</a></p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Nick Chubb.
