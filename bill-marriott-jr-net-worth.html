As the Chairman and former CEO of the company, Marriott helped transform the business into a hospitality empire with more than 7,600 properties in over 130 countries and territories. Bill owns a little over 11% of Marriott's outstanding equity as of this writing. The company was started by his father John Willard Marriott as a root beer stand in Washington, D.C., in 1927. Bill joined the company in 1954 when it was mostly a restaurant and catering business. Under Bill's direction, the company expanded dramatically into hotels around the world. Bill Marriott stepped down as CEO from the company in 2012.</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>John Willard "Bill" Marriott Jr. was born on March 25, 1932, in Washington, D.C.
