She'll be in the trailer, cleaning and cooking, the whole shebang. And I think she'd be expected to please him in the bedroom too.</p><p>"In the very beginning, Michael said to me ‘I make the money, I provide the trailer and everything, you should make me happy’.</p><p>"But I said ‘listen, it ain’t happening. I want to make money too, this is going to be a 50/50 situation’. Traveller women are all about catering to their men and that’s not something I’m into."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Lifestyle</h2></p><p>Michael, who grew up in a caravan, says the expectation is for "the man to be treated like a king". But he's since come around, allowing Nikia to set up her own beauty line called Red Hot Cosmetics.</p><p>And this is far from the only way they've broken traveller traditions, with the pair (who've both been married before) admitting they didn't wait until their wedding night to have sex.</p><p>Nikia says: "Me and Michael didn’t wait until we got married, I’m not going to lie, but that doesn’t make me a bad person."</p><p><strong>WATCH THE FIRST EPISODE OF I MARRED A TRAVELLER EXCLUSIVELY ON&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FABULOUS' YOUTUBE&nbsp;CHANNEL</a></strong></p><p>The couple swapped numbers when they met and had sex on their third weekend away, but it wasn't Michael's flashy trips to London or the Crazy Bear hotel chain which won Nikia over.</p><p>He laughs: "Eventually we stayed in the Hilton in Doncaster, that’s where the magic happened. We went to all these lovely hotels and then we waited to come back to Doncaster."</p><p>Michael grew up in a strict traveller community, which he now views as "prudish" and "outdated".</p><p>There, he says, no-one discusses sex. But the Marshalls are very open about their own love life, saying they get intimate "every couple of days", although there's the occasional "drought" in between.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000682828544.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000682829196.jpg><h2>So what about sex?</h2><p>Michael says: "With travellers, there’s no one night stands, unless it’s a big secret mission.</p><p>"It does happen, but it doesn’t get broadcast. Travelling lads who want to go off and have a bit of frisk will do it with a normal gorger girl. That's why they say they're 'not marriage material'.</p><p>"If a man has got a girlfriend, he shouldn’t be going with gorger girls. But nine out of 10 times, he will still cheat.</p><p>"Travellers like to get freaky deaky just as much as everyone else. Why do you think they get married so quick?"</p><p>Nikia adds: "Women definitely have to wait until marriage in the travelling community, men don’t.</p><p>"Basically women have to be clean and decent, but the men can go and do and f*** who they want. I don't agree with it. Not everyone waits until marriage though, they just don't talk about it."</p><p>Explaining the game travellers play before entering into a relationship, Michael says girls will reject a man at least twice, even if they fancy them, before allowing him to take her on a date and have a kiss.</p><p>There's then a "courting period" before the man asks his girlfriend's parents for permission to marry her, with the pair eventually wedding a year or two later, which is when they're finally allowed to have sex.</p><p>He says: "With Nikia, I just went off with her for the weekend. I didn’t really ask anyone for permission, because I didn’t think there would be anyone to ask."</p><p>If a man is 25, he'll date a woman between the ages of 18-21. Reason being, lower mileage. Traveller guys aren’t going to want to be with someone who’s had 50 boyfriends</p><span class=quote-credit>Michael Marshall</span><span class=quote-credit-meta>38</span><p>The couple have a 16-year age gap, which Michael says isn't unusual with his background.</p><p>He explains: "Generally, if a man is 25, he’ll date a woman between the ages of 18 and 21.</p><p>"Reason being, and I don’t want to sound sexist, but lower mileage. Traveller guys aren’t going to want to be with someone who’s had 50 boyfriends.</p><p>"If she’s been married before it’s not a big deal, people will her as ‘used goods’. She can get with anybody now, which is horrible that they think like that, but that’s just the way it is."</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Traveller slang explained</h3></p><p><strong>Gorger:</strong>&nbsp;A non-Romani or non-traveller.</p><p><strong>Grabbing:&nbsp;</strong>When a boy grabs an unmarried girl he wants to kiss, without permission.</p><p><strong>Mush:&nbsp;</strong>Man.</p><p><strong>Grunter:&nbsp;</strong>A mark, a rich man who's an easy target.</p><p><strong>Bure:</strong>&nbsp;Woman.</p><p><strong>Cushty:</strong>&nbsp;Good.</p><p><strong>Gammy:&nbsp;</strong>Bad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000678232902.jpg><p>Nikia previously exposed a group of "love rat traveller men" she claimed had been messaging her asking for sex, because they view normal girls as "easy", in a now-deleted TikTok video.</p><p>She says: "When I get messages from other men, it makes me feel worthless. It makes me feel like they think I’m a whore, when I’m really not."</p><p>Michael adds: "It comes back to the fact travellers think they’re better than everyone else. They think ‘she’s only a gorger so I can chat to her and I’ll take her’.</p><p>"In their own minds, they think they can have any woman in the world.</p><p>"We’ve discussed this before and I’ve said ‘listen you realise these men think they can go with Beyonce, that they can message Beyonce and she will reply’.</p><p>These men think they can message Beyonce and she'll reply. They've been bred with that confidence</p><span class=quote-credit>Michael Marshall</span><span class=quote-credit-meta>38</span><p>"They’ve been bred with that confidence, I was as well. But I hate it when people go after Nikia, I think ‘who does he think he is that he can message my wife?’</p><p>"Travelling men are encouraged to flirt with people, especially female clients. He’ll have a chat with her and be very charming.</p><p>"Me personally, I wouldn’t be allowed. And also out of respect for Nikia, I wouldn’t flirt with another woman."</p><h2>Modern family</h2><p>The couple are already planning a big family, admitting it's the "bigger the better" when it comes to travellers.</p><p>Michael says it's normal for men refuse to enter the labour suite when their wife's giving birth, preferring to let the baby's grandmother be in the room, so which will he choose?</p><p>He says: "When the woman’s in labour, travellers say it’s up to the man if he wants to go in or not. Sometimes the mother goes in and the man waits outside. Me personally, I’d like to be in there holding her hand."</p><p>Nikia adds: "I want Michael to be there so I can punch him while I’m giving birth. He needs to be there. If he’s not, I’ll be pissed and I’ll hold the baby in just until he comes."</p><p>And when they raise said kids, they'll be keeping their modern values.</p><p>Nikia says: "My children won’t be cleaning at home, they’ll be out studying.</p><p>"They won’t be guided to get married at 16 or have kids at 16, they’ll be guided to live a single life and get married at an appropriate age.</p><p>"I want them to feel the high of making their own money."</p><p>Michael agrees, adding: "I think it’s a waste if all travelling girls do is clean, I really do. That’s an empty life.</p><p>"Why not send your daughter to business school, to learn how to build a website and start her own business?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000678712498-2.jpg><p>You can read last week's I Married A Traveller here - which explains how their families reacted to their relationship and the awful names Nikia gets called.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>You can follow Nikia&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on Instagram</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a>.
