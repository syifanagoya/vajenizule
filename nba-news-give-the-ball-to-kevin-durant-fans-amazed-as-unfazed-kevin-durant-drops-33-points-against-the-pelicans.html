The 2 x NBA champion has achieved every feat that touches the hands of every great player in the game. A player of his caliber can score 30 points on any given night and that‚Äôs what he did against the <strong>New Orleans Pelicans</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong>Brooklyn Nets</strong> star scored 33 points and had 10 rebounds against the Pelican in 37 minutes. After <strong>Chicago Bulls</strong> ended their 12-game winning streak in their last game, Durant and Co. came out storing against the Pels who were already short-handed. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pelicans</a> were playing without Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>However, it wasn‚Äôt a good night for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Durant</a> from the field, who just made 9 of 26 shots from the field. However, he was far better from the three-point line as he shot 4 of 7 shots from beyond the arc. KD was also perfect from the free-throw line, as he made all 11 of his free throws. The former scoring champions had an impactful night against the Pelicans. While Durant was on the floor, the Nets outscored New Orleans by 20 points.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Down the stretch, KD also produced some crucial plays for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nets</a>. With 5:15 left in regulation, he made a three-pointer off an offensive rebound by Nic Claxton to give the Nets a lead of 96-92. Kyrie Irving had a crucial assist from Durant and converted a three-pointer with 43.1 seconds remaining to give the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nets</a> a 106-100 lead.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant dominate in the first fan returns of NBA All Stars</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-get-hyped-as-kevin-durant-gets-another-30-point-game-in-the-season>Fans get hyped as Kevin Durant gets another 30-point game in the season</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_COM_20230107_1228_31_2511-1024x576.jpg><p>Kevin Durant had another 30-point game of the season and fans showered the highest praise for the 1 x league MVP.
