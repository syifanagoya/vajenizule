The <a href=# class=T3D>Season 3 finale of <i>Catfish: The TV Show</i></a> is nigh, and oh what a season it's been. We saw a lot of firsts and a few traditional <i>Catfish </i>tales. The season finale starts Tuesday night with a new episode featuring <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the couple Blake and Kiersten</a>, while Wednesday night's second <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>finale episode will focus on Bianca and Brogan,</a> which should prove to be a very interesting episode, despite its familiar premise. To set the finale apart from the rest of this season, model Selita Ebanks will join the boys to get in on the Internet sleuthing game.</p><p>According to the first 10 minutes of "Bianca & Brogan" already available online, the story is the same, just with different people. Bianca is a 20-year-old living in Durham, North Carolina who has a thing for body modifications. (She has some seriously impressive gauges.) Bianca has been talking online with Brogan, a woman she met on Facebook who suddenly disappeared from the world about a year ago. Bianca couldn't get a hold of her, no Facebook messages, no calls, no texts, nothing. Then, Brogan reactivated her Facebook account and re-entered Bianca's life. <a href=# class=T3D>Does this sound familiar?</a> Bianca was just so happy to have Brogan back that she didn't ask for an explanation for her disappearance or ask her to video chat, which (shocker) the two have never done with each other. But now she needs to know the truth.</p><p>Nev and Max have enlisted Ebanks to help them get to the bottom of this, because why not? Ebanks says she is interested in online relationships and has experience with people pretending to be her online. One person in particular had her voicemail set up to say it was Ebanks' phone. Ebanks was even a catfish once, pretending to be someone else in an online relationship <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>with David Spade in a Funny or Die spoof</a> of the MTV reality show. She seems nervous but eager to talk some sense into whoever is behind Brogan's profile, so it'll be interesting to see how she reacts to her first-ever <i>Catfish</i> reveal.</p><p>You've got to applaud <i>Catfish</i> for trying to keep the series fresh this season, but Ebanks' guest spot seems a bit unnecessary to me. Her qualifications and rationale for getting in on the catfish-catching business seem tenuous, and the whole thing just seems like a gimmick. <i>Catfish </i>is already addictive on its own with Nev, Max, and the strange-but-true stories they uncover every week. Let's just hope it's not too late to save <i>Catfish</i> from truly jumping the shark.</p><p><i>Image: MTV</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHx0fJdvbGabkamzqr%2FHZqWerl2irrl5xp6rZqWfmbKtedKeo6KskWKyo63NpKpmrJ9itaa4z2auoqyYYsG4u4ypmKusXaiyor%2FOp2RsZZaeu6K4xA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
