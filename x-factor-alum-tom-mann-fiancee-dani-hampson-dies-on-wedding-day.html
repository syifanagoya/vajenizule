X Factor alum <a href=#><strong>Tom Mann</strong></a> confirmed that his fiancée, <a href=#>Dani Hampson</a>, died on what would have been their wedding day.</p><p>“I can’t believe I am writing these words but my darling Dani – my best friend, my everything and more, the love of my life – <a href=#>passed away in the early hours of Saturday morning</a>, 18th June,” the songwriter, 28, <a href=#>wrote via Instagram</a> on Monday, June 20, alongside a photo of his late partner <a href=#>holding their son, Bowie</a>. “What was supposed to be the happiest day of our lives ended in irreversible heartbreak. I feel like I have cried an ocean.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/X-Factor-Alum-Tom-Manns-Fiancee-Dies-Suddenly-Their-Wedding-Day.jpg><p>Mann continued: “<a href=#>We never made it to the alter</a> [sic]; or got to say our vows, or dance our first dance, but I know you know that you were my entire world and the best thing that has ever happened to me, Danielle.<a href=#> I will wear this ring that I was always supposed to wear</a> as a sign of my unconditional love to you.”</p><p>Hampson, 34, had no apparent health issues and the cause of her death has not been publicly revealed. The publicist and Mann, who were <a href=#>forced to postpone their September 2020 wedding</a> due to the coronavirus pandemic, welcomed Bowie in October 2021.</p><p>In his post, <a href=#>the former Stereo Kicks member</a> wrote that while he was “completely broken” by the loss of Hampson, he was using “any strength I can muster” in order to be there for the infant. “I will not be a mark on the parent that you had already become but I promise <a href=#>I will do my everything to raise Bowie</a> just the way we always wanted,” Mann wrote. “I promise you he will know how amazing his mummy was. I promise to make you so so proud.”</p><p>Describing Hampson as “the most beautiful person inside and out” and “the most incredible soul,” Mann concluded his post with a candid confession that he would be grieving “for a very, very long time.” He continued, “My darling Dani, the brightest light in any room, my world is nothing but darkness without you. I will miss you forever.”</p><p><a href=#>Mann originally auditioned for The X Factor in 2013</a> before returning the following year. He and <a href=#>four other contestants on the UK talent show</a> were placed into a boy band and they ultimately finished in fifth place. After Stereo Kicks disbanded in July 2015, Mann released music as a solo artist and worked as a songwriter and producer for artists including <a href=#><strong>Rita Ora</strong></a> and <strong>Lewis Capaldi</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hampson frequently shared her support for her fiancé’s career on social media. In April, she commemorated Bowie turning 6 months old with <a href=#>a clip of Mann serenading the little one</a> with <a href=#><strong>Elton John</strong></a>‘s songs “Cold Heart” and “Rocket Man.”</p><p>“Happy 6 months my darling boy,” she wrote via Instagram at the time. “I played this song almost every day of my 3rd trimester, it was in my labour playlist & it was number 1 the day Bowie was born… determined for it to be ‘our song’ & for it always remind us of life’s good bits.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaxZZaWsLW70WaYpa2dYsGwuYymmKemXZu2orrCnpxmnJGjtm60wKanrKeeYrGqsdJmpqdlp5qxpbXNoGSdmalk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
