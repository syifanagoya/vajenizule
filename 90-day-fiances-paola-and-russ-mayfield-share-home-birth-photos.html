They also provided a glimpse of Axel’s first moments with his parents.</p><p>The Colombia native tells&nbsp;Us&nbsp;that she chose to do a water birth at home to avoid the cold atmosphere of a hospital. “I wanted to have more control about my son. I wanted to be able to see everything what was happening with him, and I know that at the hospital, they normally take the baby away,” she explains. “So when I was talking with the midwife, she told me that I’m going to be there, he’s going to be on my chest. And I did my investigation and all about the placenta … and how to keep the baby connected to the placenta for almost two hours.”</p><p>She continues: “It’s just a long process and so natural that I was like, ‘I want to do it this way. I don’t want to go to the hospital and do it. They don’t do it that way,’ and I didn’t want to separate from my son for any minute.”</p><p>Russ, for his part, dozed off in between his wife’s contractions after the pair moved upstairs to their bed as her labor progressed. “I allowed myself to relax and I fell asleep, and then as soon as she kicked into her contractions again, I just snapped back awake,” the 31-year-old says.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Scroll to see more photos of the delivery and baby Axel!</p><p>Paola and Russ’ home birth episode of&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?&nbsp;airs on TLC Sunday, June 23, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Sharon Tharp</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkhnF5w5qwZp6ZlruksdJmp5qnnJZ6orrDZqmuq6NiuqLFxaKcpZxdqLWivsRmn6illWKvqr7ToWSpoJ%2BpvLR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
