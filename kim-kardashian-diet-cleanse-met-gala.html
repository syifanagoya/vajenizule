I'm SO excited to do this, you guys, but I definitely need to mentally prepare, lol. I have the Met Gala coming up and I've worked so hard working out, but I started eating a lot of sweets and I wanted to just change my food patterns to eat healthier and cut sugar out of my life as much as I can. We always have sweets around and it's really hard when there are temptations everywhere."</p><p id=eblz5W8EGWcS><a class=hm-link href=#>STORY: This is how Kim Kardashian toned her famous curves</a></p><p id=e00mWCVymyUA data-wc=73>She continued: "I already completed day one and two of the cleanse, and I've been surrounded by doughnuts, but I stayed away. I'm so proud of myself! I wanted to do this cleanse because the food looked so filling and there are only three days that you just drink liquids. This is seriously not a sponsored thing, I just really wanted to try it. I'll keep you updated on how I like it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/794d2cbc8537-kim-kardashian-holiday-turks-and-caicos-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ep1n13ypzJdE data-wc=14><strong>The mum-of-three showcased her toned figure on a recent holiday in Turks and Caicos</strong></p><p id=eD5PvbKbGBxm data-wc=81>Kim recently revealed that she has been working with celebrity trainer Melissa Alcantara to tone her curves, following a mix of low-intensity and high-intensity interval training with weight training to shred fat and build lean muscle. "I am firm and less cellulite and so much more confident. SO THANK YOU for waking up at 5am to do crazy body building workouts & sprints that I hate & putting me on to this lifestyle," Kim said in a post thanking her trainer.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
