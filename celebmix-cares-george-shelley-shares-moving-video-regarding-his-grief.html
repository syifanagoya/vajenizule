As truly heart-breaking as it is, often there are times when nothing can be said to try and numb the pain and the heartache that grief causes. Grief also affects people in different ways. Individuals in the music industry are not immune from experiencing grief, and often try to get their fans and supporters to speak with someone about what they are feeling.</p><p>Singer-songwriter George Shelley lost his sister, named Harriet, in a car accident last year. From his posts shared on social media, it was evident that the siblings were extremely close, and her sudden death has no doubt been difficult for his family.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BdKrYzsDc-U/?hl=en&taken-by=georgeshelley</p><p>George bravely spoke out about his grief on ‘Lorraine’ earlier this year. You can watch the segment below:</p><p></p><p>However, George recently shared a video on to his&nbsp;<a href=#>official Twitter account</a>, speaking about the impact grief has had on him, since his sister passed away.</p><p>‘This is the toughest thing I’ve ever had to do on every level, but if it helps just one person as much as it’s helped me over the last few months, I can find pride and comfort in sharing my experiences.’</p><p>https://twitter.com/higeorgeshelley/status/1002476868224933889</p><p>In his poignant and moving video, George spoke about the difficulty he has had during the grieving process and the impact that this has had on his mental health, also speaking about the stigma around it. He furthermore encouraged anyone watching the video to talk to someone – be it about grief, mental health, or anything affecting an individual – as he stated that it helped him ‘get through the process.’</p><p>In conjunction with BBC Three, his documentary on grief and the various coping mechanisms available is set to be released this summer.</p><p>In the video, George stated that he hoped his documentary would help not only him, but other people going through the difficult process of coping with the loss of a loved one.</p><p>Shortly after the release of George’s video, BBC Three shared a tweet regarding the documentary.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>We're working on a new documentary that explores the subject of young people and grief.</p><p>We’re so grateful to <a href=#>@higeorgeshelley</a> for sharing his story with us &lt;3 <a href=#>https://t.co/i9GJD4MVoD</a></p><p>— BBC Three (@bbcthree) <a href=#>June 1, 2018</a></p><p>Our thoughts continue to be with George’s family and all those who have lost a loved one in death.
