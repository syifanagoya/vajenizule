Now, the man himself is opening up about this latest setback.</p><p>During an interview with Konnan and Disco Inferno on <a href=#>K100</a>, Rey Mysterio verified that he indeed experienced a meniscus tear. He will continue working with a trainer to get himself fixed up.</p><p>Rey Mysterio said that this injury is just wear and tear on his body. Pro wrestling is a tough profession, as wrestlers travel the world, only to take bumps at every stop on the road.</p><p>“Just wear and tear. This time, it was my right knee. I’ve never had any injuries on my right knee since 97 when I had my first surgery in WCW. The left knee kept on breaking down every other year, sometimes a little bit longer. Numerous ACL tears. The last big surgery I had on my left knee was in 2011. This time, you put in all the years, I’ve been favoring the right knee for the left one and finally, I tore the meniscus on my right knee. It’s six to eight weeks. I’m in week four. I’m getting a personal trainer at the beginning of the year that’s going to work with me just so I can work on my lower body and strengthen up my hips, my quads, my legs in general so I can resist. I’ve never had a personal trainer that can train me, kind of like UFC fighters train, so I can use most of my power from the hips down.”</p><p>“I know that I’m slowing down, the older I get, but I can make things look faster just by being in the business so long, that keeps the fans the perspective of ‘he hasn’t slowed down.’ I can go out there every time and pour it out. I don’t know how to hold back. I know how to hold back on movements and stuff I know I can’t do, like pushing off my left knee is really hard. I know personally that I’ve slowed down over the years. I try to be very innovative and creative with my style that it makes it seems that I haven’t slowed down.”</p><p>We can only hope that Rey Mysterio doesn’t experience any more injuries. <a href=#>He just inked new WWE contract extension,</a> believed to be a three-year contract, so WWE wants to keep him around. He must stay healthy in order for WWE to really use him.</p><p>Rey Mysterio also has story left to be written, as his feud with Santos Escobar certainly won’t stop with the beat down that took him out of action for this current injury hiatus.</p><p>What’s your take on Rey Mysterio’s injury status in WWE? Should he keep up a full-time schedule for another three years?
